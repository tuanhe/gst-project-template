README for your project.

NOTE:
plugins can be installed locally by using "$HOME" as prefix:

  $ meson --prefix="$HOME" build/
  $ ninja -C build/ install

However be advised that the automatic scan of plugins in the user home
directory won't work under gst-build devenv.

Steps:
1, the source code is generated by gst-project-maker whick locates in 
gst-plugin-bad/tools/gst-project-maker

Command is:

$ ./gst-project-maker MyProject

2, gst-element-maker  MyProjct $BASE_CLASS
BASE_CLASS parameter (for example BASE_CLASS=videofilter), in my case use :

./gst-element-maker MyProject basesrc

3, Copy the generated source file into the project/plugin and replace the gstMyProject.c/gstMyProject.h 

4, gst-app-maker  MyProject
